Making Objects  
In this lesson we will do a deep dive into creating objects, using inheritance, and overriding a method.  Use your file from last time and program along with the video.  If you get stuck this repository has the finished python files.

Extensions-  
1. Make an enemy class which will inherit from newSprite.  Use the Octorok.png file in this repository.  You should also override the move method so that the enemy travels atleast one direction around the screen.  An if block should be used to send it in the correct direction based upon the enemy's orientation.

Challenge!!!
1. Make a sword class, you will have to get a sword sprite sheet.  It should show the sword in the different orientations (up, down, left, right).  When the spacebar is pressed, the sword should take link.orientation and use changeImage to get the correct sword orientation and place it on the correct side of Link.  Remember tiles are 32px x 32px in our game.
